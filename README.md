# AutomatedTreeStructureExtraction

Automated tree structure extraction of 2D images.

Overview
--------
This package provides a fast implementation for tree structure extraction in 2D images. 

A cell containing the traces of neurites associated with each of the somas  is the output.

More information can be found in the papers:
â€¦ 

See contents.m for list of files in the package and information about them.

How to use
--------------
The main file to run is Script.m
The major inputs for the main file is segmented soma mask and segmented binary image. A test data is available in folder: 
inputSeg.mat : segmented image of test data,
inputSoma.mat : segmented soma mask of test data.

Most crucial parameters are for seed search which are set in runCenterLineParallel.m, they can be changed if desired. Another important parameter is the angle threshold for seed search which can be changed from getNextSeed.m .
